Questions,Answers
What is ChatGPT?,"ChatGPT is a Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI that can generate textual responses based on human prompts. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to respond in varied written styles (essays, paragraphs, reports, social media posts, etc.) to prompts/questions asked by the user. ChatGPT does not generate ideas, opinions, or original thoughts. Nevertheless, educators have expressed concerns about its potential to be used academically dishonestly."
What can I do in my classes?,"To deter academic dishonesty with AI-based tools, educators can use similar strategies as with students. Connect writing assignments to learning outcomes, show stages of work, communicate clear plagiarism policies, discuss benefits of assignments, and engage in conversation. Offer alternative assignment formats and incorporate AI by having students critique, revise or evaluate AI-generated writing, engage in debates with AI tools, or teach information literacy to fact-check AI claims."
What are the other considerations I need to keep in mind?,"Student Accommodations: If you plan to modify assignments - especially in ways that require in-class, handwritten, and/or timed responses - please consider how this might impact students who have registered with the Student Disabilities Resouces Center and may need extra time or other accommodations."
What should I do if I suspect someone 'cheated' using ChatGPT and/or another AI?,"Discuss your expectations for academic integrity and the use of any AI in your course with students at the beginning of your course and again when outlining assignment instructions. If you suspect that a student violated your academic integrity policies, please follow the processes you would for other incidents and those outlined by the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity."
What can I include in my syllabus?,"**Please tailor this statement to the specific objectives of your course/college and the goals of your profession. Our hope in the OAI is for courses to spark intellectual curiosity and promote critical thinking, and the customization of this statement can reflect that in your own words.

As a partner in your learning, it is important to both of us that any assignment submission is a pure reflection of your work and understanding. The introduction of artificial intelligence options to complete academic work jeopardizes my ability to evaluate your understanding of our course content and robs you of the ability to master the subject matter.

Suspicions of use of artificial intelligence aids will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity as alleged violations of Cheating, defined as “unauthorized assistance in connection with any academic work” and/or Falsification, which includes “Misrepresenting or misleading others with respect to academic work or misrepresenting facts for an academic advantage”."
Are there any AI detectors?,"Some companies have begun to develop so-called AI detectors, which report the probability that a given writing sample was composed by an AI tool. Like any plagiarism detector, these are vulnerable to error, especially given the evolving nature of AI itself. While you may wish to use a detector as an aid in identifying AI-generated writing, its evaluation should never be relied upon as the sole evidence for questioning a student’s academic integrity.
